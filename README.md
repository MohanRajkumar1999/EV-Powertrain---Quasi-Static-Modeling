In this repository, you will find the development of a quasi-static electric powertrain model. The process starts with:

Drive Cycle
Vehicle Body
Transmission
Motor
Motor Controller
Battery
Results
Using data from the Nissan Leaf vehicle model, we simulate this powertrain under different drive cycles such as MNEDC, Urban, and Rural cycles. With these simulations, we can determine the following:

Wheel speed
Wheel torque
Motor speed
Motor torque
Additional drive data, including:
Battery power
Battery capacity
Total number of cells
Number of cells in series and parallel
Regenerative power
SOC and regenerative SOC
Battery power
With this data, we are able to calibrate and validate the powertrain to achieve the desired results.
